# Contributing to Vaprobash

Please make pull requests to the **Master** branch.

Vaprobash now uses SemVer, so bug fixes/tweaks will create patch releases and new features will create minor releases.

Note that this means that bug fixes and minor tweaks will likely get accepted before feature additions, however all PR's will be reviewed!
